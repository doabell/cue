Named after CUE!, a game with 16 characters & colors.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Quick start

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Built with Claude

Plus some Copilot GPT-4o.

Almost everything worked out fine, except for the dark mode toggle, where Claude tried a few times.

Claude Code was at capacity, so I could not join.
